Your task is to print these variables in the following formats:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>With space:</strong> Print a and b in a single line, separated by a space, followed by a newline.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Without newline:</strong> Print a and b separated by a space, but do not end the output with a newline.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>With separator:</strong> Print a and b separated by a specified separator, followed by a newline.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Without space:</strong> Print a and b in a single line, with no spaces between them, followed by a newline.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input</strong></span>: <span style="font-size: 18px;">a = "Hello", b = "World", separator = '&amp;'
<strong>Output:</strong> <br>Hello World<br></span><span style="font-size: 18px;">Hello WorldHello&amp;World<br>HelloWorld
<strong>Explanation</strong>: <br><strong>With space:</strong> a and b are printed in a single line with a space separating them. (Hello World)
<strong>Without newline:</strong> a and b are printed in a single line with a space separating them, but no newline is added after. (Hello World with no newline).
<strong>With separator: </strong>a and b are printed in a single line, separated by the given separator character. (Hello&amp;World)
<strong>Without space: </strong>a and b are printed directly next to each other with no space between them. (HelloWorld)</span></pre></div>
