# GeeksforGeeks Solutions

Welcome to a curated collection of **GeeksforGeeks** problem solutions — a practical archive for practicing and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **C++**.

## About

I’m **Saransh Bangar**, a final-year undergraduate student at **SRM Institute of Science and Technology** and an aspiring software developer. This repository serves as my personal log of solved problems to reinforce my DSA skills, maintain consistency, and provide useful solutions to others.

## Repository Structure

* **Language:** C++, Python
* **Organization:** Solutions are categorized by difficulty level and problem type, following a clear and consistent naming convention.
* **Readability:** Each solution emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and practical coding patterns.

## Purpose

* Regular practice of DSA concepts and maintaining productive GitHub activity.
* Providing learners with well-structured solutions and coding paradigms.
* Documenting my problem-solving progress over time.

## Contributing

This is currently a solo learning project. However, if you identify an improvement, optimization, or want to suggest enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. All feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Future Roadmap

* Add more advanced topics and problem sets.
* Include detailed explanations or in-code comments.
* Expand the repository to include other programming languages or curated problem collections.

## How to Use

Browse the folders, review the solutions, and run the code. Feel free to refer to these implementations as you practice or study.
