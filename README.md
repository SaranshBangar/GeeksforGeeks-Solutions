# GeeksforGeeks-Solutions by Saransh Bangar

Hey there, fellow code wranglers! 👋

Welcome to my coding playground, where the bugs are features and errors are just happy little accidents. I'm Saransh Bangar, a second-year software engineering sorcerer at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Behold, my brainchild – "GeeksforGeeks-Solutions." 🚀

## 🤔 Why This Coding Carnival?

Picture this: a coding enthusiast who loves DSA problems and wants to stay GitHub-active. That's me! I decided, why not create a repository that kills two birds with one stone? Hence, this collection of algorithmic wonders was born.

## 🗃️ Inside the Mystery Box

- **Organization:** Ever wanted to solve problems by shouting "easy-peasy" or "bring it on"? Now you can! Solutions are neatly categorized by difficulty, and then we throw them into the magical realm of alphabetical order.

- **Programming Language:** The chosen incantation for this repository is C++. It's like the magic wand of programming languages – versatile, powerful, and occasionally mysterious.

## 🤝 One-Man Coding Symphony

This is a solo journey through the coding cosmos. But hey, if you stumble upon this repository and think, "I could make this even cooler," hit me up with your ideas. Who knows, maybe we'll turn this solo into a duet!

### How to Contribute?

1. Imagine contributing.
2. Realize it's a solo project.
3. Contribute in spirit and wish me luck. 🍀

## 🚀 Future Plans: The Coding Odyssey Continues

What's next, you ask? More problems, more C++ wizardry, and maybe, just maybe, a feature where the code writes itself. A coder can dream, right?

## 🎉 Coding Fiesta

Enough talk, more code! Dive in, dance with the algorithms, and remember: bugs are just misunderstood features. Happy coding, my fellow wizards! 🧙‍♂️🚀
